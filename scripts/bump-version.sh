# bump-version.sh — set the microsandbox release version across every SDK
# manifest in one shot.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/bump-version.sh <new-version> [<old-version>]
#   e.g. scripts/bump-version.sh 0.4.6
#        scripts/bump-version.sh 0.4.6 0.4.5   # mop up a partial bump
#
# If <old-version> is omitted, it's auto-detected from the first
# `version = "X.Y.Z"` line in the root Cargo.toml. Pass it explicitly when
# re-running against a tree that's already partway through a bump (e.g. a
# prior run touched Cargo.toml but missed the example manifests).
#
# Updates:
#   - Cargo.toml (workspace.package.version + path-dep `version = "X.Y.Z"`
#     and exact `version = "=X.Y.Z"` refs for internal crates)
#     entries across crates/*/Cargo.toml, packages/*/rust/Cargo.toml, and sdk/*/Cargo.toml)
#   - crates/agentd/Cargo.lock (the agentd sub-workspace ships its own
#     lockfile that the root `cargo check` won't refresh — targeted sed
#     against microsandbox-* entries)
#   - packages/agent-client/typescript/package.json
#   - packages/microsandbox-types/typescript/package.json
#   - sdk/node-ts/package.json (top-level + optionalDependencies versions)
#   - sdk/node-ts/npm/*/package.json (per-platform npm sub-packages)
#   - sdk/node-ts/native/index.cjs (napi-rs binding loader; pins the
#     expected native package version for runtime mismatch checks)
#   - examples/typescript/*/package.json (microsandbox dep pin in every
#     TypeScript example)
#   - sdk/go/setup.go (sdkVersion constant; consumed by EnsureInstalled to
#     resolve the GitHub release artefact URL for libmicrosandbox_go_ffi)
#   - sdk/dotnet package metadata and versioned README commands
#
# Cargo.lock entries for workspace-versioned crates are bumped by sed,
# but the script does not do a full cargo-driven regen — run `cargo
# check` afterwards if you also need any dependency-graph changes
# reflected.
#
# Does NOT text-bump package-lock.json files. release-bump.yml regenerates
# packages/agent-client/typescript/package-lock.json and packages/microsandbox-types/typescript/package-lock.json during the release PR, and
# release.yml's `refresh-lockfile` job re-resolves sdk/node-ts/package-lock.json
# against the just-published platform packages and opens a follow-up PR.
# (Text-bumping lockfiles would make them "look consistent" but lie about
# integrity.)
